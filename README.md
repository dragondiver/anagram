## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Two words are defined as anagrams if they do share the same letters, but are in a different order (i.e. the English words race and care are anagrams).<br>
Given an input file which contains one word per line, as an output construct a list of all anagrams from that input file. Print those words to the console, where all words that are an anagram should each other should be on the same line.

**For ease of coding i reduced the language of words to english**
