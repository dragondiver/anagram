## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Two words are defined as anagrams if they do share the same letters, but are in a different order (i.e. the English words race and care are anagrams).<br>
Given an input file which contains one word per line, as an output construct a list of all anagrams from that input file. Print those words to the console, where all words that are an anagram should each other should be on the same line.

**For ease of coding i reduced the language of words to english**

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

This project is based on:
- jdk17
- git
- Apache Maven 3.8.4


To get the code please clone from Github: https://github.com/dragondiver/anagram.git

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dragondiver/anagram.git
```

### Installing

Change into folder *anagram* and build using maven

```sh
mvn clean package
```

## üîß Setting up testdata

CChange into folder testdata. There is a file called setup.sh, ensure that you can execute it. This file uses the english dictionary, that is build into macos. 

If you are running another OS please check, if you can find this file somewhere in the internet and dowonload it. Adjust setup.sh afterwards.

After you executed setup.sh you should find 3 files in folder testdata:

```zsh
./setup.sh
rm: englishwords.txt: No such file or directory
rm: manyenglishwords.txt: No such file or directory
rm: awholelotofenglishwords.txt: No such file or directory
  235886 englishwords.txt
 11794300 manyenglishwords.txt
       7 sample.txt
       4 setup.sh
 12030197 total
 ```
